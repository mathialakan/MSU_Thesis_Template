abstract={We present results from our ongoing work developing a multi-dimensional, unconditionally stable, linear-time higher order1 wave equation solver. Our goal is to extend the implicit method we have been developing to the problem of general scatterers with non-reflecting boundary conditions and to assess the accuracy of our method on classical E.M. problems. Since traditional approaches to wave scattering problems using Fast Fourier Transform, finite element, and finite difference methods have restrictions (range of wave form) and have high spatio-temporal cost, we are exploring a new approach based on successive convolution. The method is implicit and hence does not suffer from a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) time step restriction. Further, the implicit scheme is applicable to multidimensional problems and is ideally suited for multi-scale temporal problems. The method is based on an A-stable (to all orders) solver for the two way wave equation1. The formulation of the method is based on the Method of Lines Transpose (MOLT2) - a practical approach to Rothe's method - which starts by discretizing the problem in time and then solving the resulting Helmholtz equation with a Green's function method2. By leveraging an alternating direction implicit (ADI) splitting and a fast convolution method for the 1D Green's function, it can be shown that the method has O(N) computational cost. High-order accuracy is achieved through successive convolution1. While the method was not originally designed for classical E.M. scattering problems (it was designed for multi-scale problems), we aim to apply highorder implementations of the method to this application as well.},
